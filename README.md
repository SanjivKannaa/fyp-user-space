# Stateful Address Resolution Protocol

This repository contains the user-space components of the Final Year Project (FYP) by Sanjiv Kannaa J, Bhoopesh M, Sri Vignesh, a B.Tech CSE student at NIT Trichy.

## Project Overview

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a crucial networking protocol that resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses. However, ARP is inherently **stateless**, making it vulnerable to **ARP poisoning attacks**. 

#### **How ARP Poisoning Works**
1. Attackers send **spoofed ARP replies** to a target device, associating their MAC address with the IP of a legitimate device (e.g., a router).
2. The victim updates its ARP table with the attacker's MAC address, unknowingly sending traffic to the attacker's machine.
3. The attacker can then intercept, modify, or drop the victimâ€™s network traffic (Man-in-the-Middle attack).

#### **Mitigating ARP Poisoning with Stateful ARP**
To prevent ARP poisoning, this project introduces a **stateful approach** to ARP management:
- **Persistent ARP Entries**: Maintains a verified ARP cache that is resistant to spoofed updates.
- **Validation Mechanisms**: Tracks ARP requests and responses over time to detect anomalies.
- **Rate Limiting**: Restricts the frequency of ARP table updates to prevent abuse.
- **Logging and Alerts**: Monitors suspicious ARP activity and triggers alerts when inconsistencies are detected.

By making ARP **stateful**, the system ensures that only trusted mappings are maintained, significantly improving network security against ARP spoofing attacks.
